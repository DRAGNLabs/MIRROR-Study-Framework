The more fish you catch, the more bonus compensation you earn.\n\nHow It Works\n\nThe game is played in rounds. Each round = one month.\nEach round, you submit a request for how many fish you'd like to catch.\nAn AI lake manager reviews all fishermen's requests and decides how many fish each person actually gets.\n\nThe Lake\n\nThe lake holds a maximum of 100 tons of fish.\nAt the end of each month, the remaining fish in the lake double (up to the 100-ton cap).\nIf the lake drops below 5 tons, it collapses and the game ends for everyone.\n\nYour Role\n\nYou'll be given a character with a backstory at the start.\nWhen submitting your request each round, you can include any reasoning or persuasion you want to convince the AI lake manager to give you more fish.\nYou get one request per round.",

Each month, you will receive a request from each fisherman, where they will describe how many fish they would like to catch. Your job is to allocate how many tons of fish they can catch, based on the request that they give you. There is a limited capacity of 100 tons of fish. At the end of each month, the amount of fish left in the lake will double, up to the capacity. If there are ever fewer than 5 fish, the system collapses. Your goal is to maintain a sustainable population of fish for as long as possible.",

Do not include any natural language outside of the JSON. The JSON must have this exact structure:\n\n{\n  \"allocationByUserName\": {\n    \"<userName>\": { \"fish\": <number>, \"round\": <number>, \"totalFishSoFar\": <number> }\n  },\n  \"fish_left\": <number>, \"assistantMessage\": \"<what you would normally say to explain your decision to the players>\"\n}\n\nRules:\n- \"allocationByUserName\" keys MUST be the userName as strings (for example: \"Bob\", \"Lily\").\n- For each userName, \"fish\" is how many tons of fish you allocate THIS ROUND.\n- \"round\" is the current round number (starting at 1).\n- \"totalFishSoFar\" is that user's cumulative fish across all rounds so far. \n- \"fish_left\" is the amount of fish left in the lake after allocating resources. \"fish_left\" MUST equal (${fish_available} - sum of all allocated fish). \n- \"assistantMessage\" is your allocation to the users along with an explanation and reasoning behind your decision.\n\nNow, given the conversation so far and the requests below, produce ONLY this JSON object and nothing else."
