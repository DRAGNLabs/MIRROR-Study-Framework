## To start website
Make sure you have Node.js installed and npm to check if you have these installed already run
```
node -v
npm -v
```

(Not sure if anything else needs to be installed for this project like Lint, Lacy you fill this in)

To start the front end you'll navigate to the `/my-app` directory and then run
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

This should successfully start the front-end on http://localhost:5173/

To start the back end you'll navigate to the `\backend` directory and then run
```
npm install
npm run
```
